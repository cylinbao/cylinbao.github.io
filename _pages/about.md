I am a final-year Ph.D. student in the CSE department at the University of Washington. My research focuses on the intersection of machine learning, systems, and computer architecture, with an emphasis on efficiency and acceleration. I believe that efficiency is key to the continued growth and sustainability of future machine learning and AI applications. I am fortunate to be advised by Professor Luis Ceze and work closely with Professor Baris Kasikci. I am also a member of the awesome [Sampl](https://sampl.cs.washington.edu) research group.

Prior to UW, I obtained my Bachelor and Master degree from Department of Electronics Engineering, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (previously NCTU, now NYCU), advised by Prof. Bo-Cheng Lai. 

Besides research, I enjoy outdoor activities such as tennis, hiking and (backcountry) skiing.
