I am a <strong>final-year</strong> Ph.D. student in the CSE department at the University of Washington. 
My research lies on the intersection of machine learning, systems, and computer architecture, with an emphasis on <strong>efficiency</strong> and <strong>acceleration</strong>. 
I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Luis Ceze](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~luisceze/) and also work closely with Professor [Baris Kasikci](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~baris/). I am also a member of the awesome [Sampl](https://sampl.cs.washington.edu) research group.

Prior to UW, I obtained my Bachelor and Master degree from Department of Electronics Engineering, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (previously NCTU, now NYCU), advised by Prof. Bo-Cheng Lai. 

Besides research, I enjoy outdoor activities such as tennis, hiking and (backcountry) skiing.
